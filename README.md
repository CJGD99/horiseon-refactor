# horiseon-refactor
Week 1 / Refactor Challenge - "Horiseon".

## Introduction:

This application was built as a refactoring challenge by Chad Dowdall.
The source code was edited to include semantic HTML, some accessibility features, a new structure for the HTML page including comments, and a re-ordered CSS page with comments as well.
These editions improve the code by making it more readable, accessible, and user friendly.

## Installation:

You can obtain this code from my repository on github [here](https://github.com/CJGD99/horiseon-refactor).

Use the git clone command to clone this repo to your local directory and open in a code editor software to begin editing the code.

## Usage:

This application so far has only one use: to provide the user with information. It includes one interactive function which is the nav bar containing links to the information on the page. Use the links by left clicking on them and you will be taken to the corresponding section on the page.

The nav bar: ![nav-bar-screenshot](/assets/images/nav-bar-screenshot.png).
